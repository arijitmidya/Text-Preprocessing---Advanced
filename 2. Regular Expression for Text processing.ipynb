    "patterns or rules. For example, let’s say we have a text document containing a list of email addresses. We can use metacharacters to search for all the\n",
    "email addresses that follow a specific pattern. Suppose we want to extract all the email addresses that end with @hello.com from the document. We can\n",
    "use the .* metacharacter to represent any number of characters before @hello.com. Here’s an example regular expression pattern using\n",
    "metacharacters: .*@hello\\.com. In this pattern, the .* metacharacter sequence matches any number of characters (including zero characters) before \n",
    "the @ symbol. The . represents the literal dot character because the dot is also a metacharacter that matches any character. Finally, the \\.com pattern\n",
    "matches the .com characters in the email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common metacharacters :\n",
    "\n",
    "Dot (.): This metacharacter matches exactly one character. For example, c.t would match any three-letter word beginning with c and ending with t.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asterisk, aka Kleene star (*): This metacharacter matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element. For example, a* would match zero or more \n",
    "occurrences of the letter a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus symbol, aka Kleene plus (+): This metacharacter matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element. For example, a+ would match one or more\n",
    "occurrences of the letter a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question mark (?): This metacharacter matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element. For example, a? would match zero or one occurrence of\n",
    "the letter a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caret (^): We use this metacharacter as the beginning of the line anchor. It asserts that the following pattern must start at the beginning of a line.\n",
    "For example, the ^hello pattern will only match if the input text starts with hello.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dollar sign ($): We use this metacharacter as the end-of-the-line anchor. It asserts that the preceding pattern must end at the end of a line. For \n",
    "example, the world$ pattern will only match if the input text ends with world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipe (|): This metacharacter allows us to specify multiple options or alternatives for matching. It allows us to match any one of a set of possible\n",
    "patterns, effectively creating a logical OR operation. The pipe symbol denotes it |. For example, th(e|is|at) will return the and this in this is the \n",
