    "Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, are a handy tool for finding patterns in text data. More specifically, they’re a sequence of characters \n",
    "that define a search pattern, which can be used to match or replace specific parts of a string. We use regular expressions in text preprocessing tasks \n",
    "such as cleaning, tokenization, and pattern recognition. The ability to use regular expressions to quickly and accurately process large volumes of text\n",
    "makes them an essential tool for NLP and data science applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application of regex :\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use regex to carry out various NLP tasks. For example, in tokenization, we use regular expressions to identify delimiters between words,\n",
    "sentences, or paragraphs. We use regex to remove unwanted characters, punctuation, or whitespace in text cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are also instrumental in web scraping and data mining tasks, where we need to extract specific information from web pages or large \n",
    "datasets. Regex can identify patterns in web pages’ HTML or XML source code and extract relevant information such as email addresses, phone numbers, \n",
    "URLs, or other structured data. A great example is using regex to collect data on job openings from LinkedIn, Indeed, and other job sites.\n",
